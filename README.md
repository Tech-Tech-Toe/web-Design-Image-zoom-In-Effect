## Image Zooming Effect
This project demonstrates a simple and elegant image zooming effect using HTML and CSS. The effect is activated when the user hovers over the image, creating an engaging and interactive visual experience.

## Features
**Centered Layout:** The layout is designed to center the image both horizontally and vertically within the viewport using Flexbox. This ensures that the image remains prominently displayed in the center of the screen.
**Hover Zoom Effect:** When the user hovers over the image, a smooth zoom-in effect is triggered. The image scales up to twice its original size, enhancing its details and drawing attention.
**Fixed Container:** The image is enclosed within a fixed-size container with rounded corners and hidden overflow. This ensures that the zoomed image stays within its designated area and does not spill over.
**Smooth Transition:** The zoom effect is executed smoothly over a duration of 0.8 seconds, thanks to CSS transitions. This provides a fluid and visually pleasing experience.
## Usage
To incorporate this effect into your project, simply include the provided HTML and CSS structure. Make sure to use an appropriate image path for the src attribute in the <img> tag. The effect can be customized by adjusting the CSS properties as needed.
